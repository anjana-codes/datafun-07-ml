 Objectives: This project 7 will use Supervised Machine learning to create a linear regression model for a data set and then use that model to make predictions.

## Create GitHub Repository
```
 GitHub Repository: datafun-07-ml
 Documentation: README.md
 Notebook: anjana_ml.ipynb
```

## Clone to VS Code 
```
git clone site_URL
```

## Adding files 
- Add a .py file to work in.
- Include a .gitignore file to exclude the .venv file from the rest of the Python environment.
- Create a .venv to act as the virtual environment.
- Add a requirements.txt file to hold the required project modules.



## Create Project Virtual Environment
```
 py -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\activate
```

## Install all Required Packages
```
 py -m pip install jupyterlab pandas pyarrow matplotlib seaborn sklearn
 py -m pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

## Git add and commit
```
git add .
git commit -m "start a project"
git push origin main
```

## Implement 10.16 and 15.4 from the textbook 

- Part 1: Chart a Straight Line: Follow the instructions from 10.16 (starting page 414).

- Part 2: Predict Avg High Temp in NYC in January: Follow the instructions from 10.16 (starting page 416).

- Part 3: Predict Avg High Temp in NYC in January: Follow the steps in 15.4 (starting page 620 in your textbook).


- Part 4: Insights comparing the two models.

- Part 5: Bonus: Follow through 15.5 (starting page 625) with the California Housing Dataset.

## Repeat git add and commit
```
git add .
git commit -m "project is done"
git push origin main
```
